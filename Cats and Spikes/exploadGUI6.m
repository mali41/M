function varargout = exploadGUI6(varargin)
% EXPLOADGUI6 MATLAB code for exploadGUI6.fig
%      EXPLOADGUI6, by itself, creates a new EXPLOADGUI6 or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = EXPLOADGUI6 returns the handle to a new EXPLOADGUI6 or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      EXPLOADGUI6('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in EXPLOADGUI6.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      EXPLOADGUI6('Property','Value',...) creates a new EXPLOADGUI6 or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before exploadGUI6_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to exploadGUI6_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
